# My Repo Stats Django

This small Django app shows a breakdown of what part of the day commits were made on a given repository hosted on Github.

It is a rough prototype built mainly to practice working with Django, Python, and Postgres. It also showcases a lightweight project management processs.

The project management documents are open source and can be accessed [here](https://serious-swordtail-48f.notion.site/Project-Django-d6e9cfedc4cf4a8381079a92e8d5df10). 

There is also a blog article explaining how the project was managed from start to finish, which can be found on [dev.to](https://dev.to/freddyhm/how-i-manage-my-projects-a-step-by-step-guide-kj).
