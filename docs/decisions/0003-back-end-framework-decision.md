# **Back-End Framework Decision**

## Date

09/14/2023

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

We need to decide which back-end python framework to use to supply our application with common functionalities like routing, request management, middleware, etc. 

## **Decision**

Given our focus is on getting hands-on experience with the language, any framework will do. We will go with the most widely used which is Django given our quick research.

## Alternatives

- Flask

## Risks

Our application may be best built with a more lightweight framework. It may be easier to use as well.

## **Consequences**

Our application may be bloated from the start but we should have rich documentation to quickly build something.
